`# IntroductionToRobotics ( 2023 - 2024 )


The Robotics laboratory assignments are part of the curriculum for third-year students at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each assignment encompasses specified criteria, detailed implementation instructions, as well as accompanying code and image files.

# Homework no. 1 

This task emphasizes the management of each channel (Red, Green, and Blue) of an RGB LED through three separate potentiometers according to the following setup:

# Homework no. 2

For this task I will be implementing a 3-floor elevator simulator using Arduino and a few components, such as LEDs, buttons and a buzzer. 
Taking the process step by step, I began by placing 3 buttons on a breadboard which I then connected to 3 LEDs, one LED for each button. Each LED has also its own resistor (I used the 330 Ω ones) that is connected to GND on the breadboard. I used a fourth LED and implemented it so that when the elevator is moving it is blinking, then when the elevator is in idle state it stays on. The last step was adding the buzzer, which makes different-toned noises when the elevator leaves a floor or arrives at a floor.

# Homework no. 3

This task consists of using a 7-segment display and "drawing" on it by using a joystick to move through the component's segments and making them light. For each segment of the display I used a resistor (220Ω or 330Ω) which I then connected to the arduino pins as seen in the following scheme.

Lastly, I connected the joystick to the arduino and got to work.
