# IntroductionToRobotics ( 2023 - 2024 )


The Robotics laboratory assignments are part of the curriculum for third-year students at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each assignment encompasses specified criteria, detailed implementation instructions, as well as accompanying code and image files.

# Homework no. 1 

This task emphasizes the management of each channel (Red, Green, and Blue) of an RGB LED through three separate potentiometers according to the following setup:

# Homework no. 2

For this task I will be implementing a 3-floor elevator simulator using Arduino and a few components, such as LEDs, buttons and a buzzer. 
Taking the process step by step, I began by placing 3 buttons on a breadboard which I then connected to 3 LEDs, one LED for each button. Each LED has also its own resistor (I used the 330 Î© ones) that is connected to GND on the breadboard.
